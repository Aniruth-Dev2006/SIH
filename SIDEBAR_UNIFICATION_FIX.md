# ✅ SIDEBAR UNIFICATION FIX - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Issue:** Sidebar jumping/shifting and inconsistent three-dot menu on 5 alumni pages

---

## 🎯 Problem Identified

### Faulty Pages (Before Fix):
1. ❌ Alumni Mentorship
2. ❌ Alumni Network
3. ❌ Alumni Connect
4. ❌ Alumni Donations
5. ❌ Alumni Feedback

### Root Cause:
These 5 pages included an **extra header partial** (`<%- include('partials/header') %>`) that:
- Added duplicate CSS variables and styling
- Was included AFTER the `<body>` tag (invalid HTML structure)
- Created visual conflicts with the main `alumni.css`
- Caused sidebar to shift/jump when navigating between pages
- Made theme toggle behave inconsistently

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changes Made:

**Removed the problematic header include from all 5 faulty pages:**

```diff
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="/alumni.css">
- </head>
- <body>
-     <div class="toast-container" id="toastContainer"></div>
-     <%- include('partials/header') %>

+ <link rel="stylesheet" href="/alumni.css">
+ <script>
+     (function() {
+         const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light');
+         if (savedTheme === 'dark') {
+             document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
+         }
+     })();
+ </script>
+ </head>
+ <body>
+     <!-- Toast Container -->
+     <div class="toast-container" id="toastContainer" role="alert" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"></div>
```

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `views/alumni_mentorship.ejs`
2. ✅ `views/alumni_network.ejs`
3. ✅ `views/alumni_connect.ejs`
4. ✅ `views/alumni_donations.ejs`
5. ✅ `views/alumni_feedback.ejs`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Was Removed:
```html
<!-- This problematic include was removed from 5 pages: -->
<%- include('partials/header') %>
```

### What Was Added:
```html
<!-- Anti-flicker script added to all 5 fixed pages: -->
<script>
    (function() {
        const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 
            (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches ? 'dark' : 'light');
        if (savedTheme === 'dark') {
            document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
        }
    })();
</script>
```

### Why This Works:
1. **Eliminates CSS Conflicts:** No duplicate CSS variable definitions
2. **Proper HTML Structure:** Anti-flicker script in `<head>` where it belongs
3. **Single Source of Truth:** All pages use the same sidebar partial
4. **Consistent Styling:** All pages load `alumni.css` without interference
5. **No Layout Shifts:** Sidebar structure is identical across all pages
